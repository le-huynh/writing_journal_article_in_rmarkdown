abstract = {In temperate latitudes, toxic cyanobacteria blooms often occur in eutrophied ecosystems during warm months. Many common bloom-forming cyanobacteria have toxic and non-toxic strains which co-occur and are visually indistinguishable but can be quantified molecularly. Toxic Microcystis cells possess a suite of microcystin synthesis genes (mcyA-mcyJ), while non-toxic strains do not. For this study, we assessed the temporal dynamics of toxic and non-toxic strains of Microcystis by quantifying the microcystin synthetase gene (mcyD) and the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene, 16S (an indicator of total Microcystis), from samples collected from four lakes across the Northeast US over a two-year period. Nutrient concentrations and water quality were measured and experiments were conducted which examined the effects of elevated levels of temperatures (+4 °C), nitrogen, and phosphorus on the growth rates of toxic and non-toxic strains of Microcystis. During the study, toxic Microcystis cells comprised between 12{\%} and 100{\%} of the total Microcystis population in Lake Ronkonkoma, NY, and between 0.01{\%} and 6{\%} in three other systems. In all lakes, molecular quantification of toxic (mcyD-possessing) Microcystis was a better predictor of in situ microcystin levels than total cyanobacteria, total Microcystis, chlorophyll a, or other factors, being significantly correlated with the toxin in every lake studied. Experimentally enhanced temperatures yielded significantly increased growth rates of toxic Microcystis in 83{\%} of experiments conducted, but did so for non-toxic Microcystis in only 33{\%} of experiments, suggesting that elevated temperatures yield more toxic Microcystis cells and/or cells with more mcyD copies per cell, with either scenario potentially yielding more toxic blooms. Furthermore, concurrent increases in temperature and P concentrations yielded the highest growth rates of toxic Microcystis cells in most experiments suggesting that future eutrophication and climatic warming may additively promote the growth of toxic, rather than non-toxic, populations of Microcystis, leading to blooms with higher microcystin content. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {The mechanisms regulating toxin release by cyanobacteria are poorly understood despite the threat cyanotoxins pose to water quality and human health globally. To determine the potential for temperature to regulate microcystin release by toxin-producing cyanobacteria, we evaluated seasonal patterns of water temperature, cyanobacteria biomass, and extracellular microcystin concentration in a eutrophic freshwater lake dominated by Planktothrix agardhii. We replicated seasonal variation in water temperature in a concurrent laboratory incubation experiment designed to evaluate cause-effect relationships between temperature and toxin release. Lake temperature ranged from 3 to 27 °C and cyanobacteria biomass increased with warming up to 18 °C, but declined rapidly thereafter with further increases in temperature. Extracellular microcystin concentration was tightly coupled with temperature and was most elevated between 20 and 25 °C, which was concurrent with the decline in cyanobacteria biomass. A similar trend was observed in laboratory incubations where productivity-specific microcystin release was most elevated between 20 and 25 °C and then declined sharply at 30 °C. We applied generalized linear mixed modeling to evaluate the strength of water temperature as a predictor of cyanobacteria abundance and microcystin release, and determined that warming ≥ 20 °C would result in a 36{\%} increase in microcystin release when Chlorophyll a was ≤ 50 $\mu$g l− 1. These results show a temperature threshold for toxin release in P. agardhii, which demonstrates a potential to use water temperature to forecast bloom severity in eutrophic lakes where blooms can persist year-round with varying degrees of toxicity.},

abstract = {The temporal distribution of bloom-forming cyanobacteria- Microcystis and its correlation with related physical and chemical variables including the total nitrogen-to-total phosphorus ratio (TN:TP), the ammonium-to-nitrate ratio (NH4-N:NOX-N), water temperature, and pH in the north part of Lake Taihu (Meiliang Bay) were investigated, using a continuous, 11-year record of environmental data (1992-2002) and phytoplankton species. A multivariate statistical analysis, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), revealed a negative correlation between the Microcystis and TN:TP, and a positive correlation between the Microcystis and NH4-N:NOX-N, water temperature and pH. Warm water temperature was the principal force driving Microcystis blooms, which were preceded declining concentrations of nitrogen compounds. Microcystis tended to dominate (Microcystis contributed above 50{\%} to total algal mass) in the north part of Lake Taihu during summer when the TN:TP mass ratio was less than 30, NH4-N:NOX-N was below 1, and a critical water temperature ranged from 25°C to 30°C, respectively. Meanwhile, suspended solids (SS) concentrations exceeded 10mgl-1 and pH exceeded 8.0 during blooms. Overall, this study advances our understanding of nutrient enrichment and high ambient temperature influences on Microcystis biomass. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},
